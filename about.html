          <p>I have been an entertainer since the age of 10. I would always go through my mother’s makeup drawer, dress up like the 90s Korean divas, and lip sync my heart out whenever my parents were at work. Fast forward to sophomore year of college, I started going to local drag shows and knew that I had to become a drag queen. I have been performing ever since as Erica Balenciaga around the world - Shanghai, South Korea, and now New York City baby! I like to describe my drag style as fierce, energetic, and polished. My inspirations come from pop culture, the ballroom scene, beauty pageants, fashion editorials, runways, K-POP, and MORE! If you want to see me in action follow me on Instagram for upcoming events. If you want a memorable birthday, bachelorette party, Quinceañera, baby shower, or whatever book me!</p>
